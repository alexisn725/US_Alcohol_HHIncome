# US Alcohol Sales and Household Income

## Data Set 1 - Median Household Income by State

This project uses a data set provided by the US government as part of the Current Population Survey with the *US Census Bureau*. The link to the table I used can be found here:

I used the data table **Table H-8. Median Household Income by State** for this project, but there are several more tables that break down the findings of the Current Population Survey that are pretty interesting if you're keen to find more statistics on Median Household Income in the USA. 

## Data Set 2 - Alcohol Sales by State

This project also uses a data set provided by the US government as part of their Surveillance Reports from the *National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.* The link can be found here:  

https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/surveillance-covid-19/COVSALES.htm

The data set provided was used to create the Surveillance Report: **Alcohol Sales During the COVID-19 Pandemic** and contains per capita alcohol sales between the years of 2017 - 2021 of beer, wine, and spirits during the Covid-19 pandemic for 13 states so far. The NIAAA also created several charts of their own on the data; if you're interested in viewing more I would definitely take a look. 

# Summary:
My aim was to combine these two datasets to see if there was a correlation within the states between median household income and alcohol sales, during the Covid pandemic years. 

For both data sets, I downloaded the .xlsx data file provided by the researchers and converted that into a CSV file for ease. Once that was done I cleaned the data to get rid of extraneous information, and merged the two using a pandas merge. Once that was completed, I wa sable to analyze the data to find:
